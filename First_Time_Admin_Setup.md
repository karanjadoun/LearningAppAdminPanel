- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **A Firebase Project** (for storing your app‚Äôs data)

## 2. **Download & Extract the Admin Panel**

1. Download the source code (ZIP file) from Codecanyon or your purchase location.
2. Find the ZIP file in your Downloads folder.
3. **Right-click** the ZIP file and choose **Extract All** (Windows) or **Open With > Archive Utility** (Mac).
4. Choose a folder you can easily find, like your Desktop or Documents.

---

## 3. **Install Node.js and npm**

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the **LTS** version (recommended for most users).
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation steps (just click Next/Continue until it‚Äôs done).
4. To check if it worked, open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) and type:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both.

---

## 4. **Install Project Dependencies**

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux).
2. Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you extracted the admin panel. For example:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/LearningAppAdminPanel
   ```
   *(Tip: You can type `cd `, then drag the folder into the terminal and press Enter!)*
3. Run this command to install everything the project needs:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This may take a few minutes. You‚Äôll see a lot of messages‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs normal!

## 5. **Set Up Firebase**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click **Add project** and follow the steps (give it any name you like).
3. In your Firebase project, click the **gear icon > Project settings**.
4. Scroll down to **Your apps** and click **</>** (Web) to add a new web app.
5. Copy the config values shown (apiKey, authDomain, etc.).
6. Open the file `src/config/firebase.ts` in a text editor (like VS Code or Notepad).
7. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase config. Example:
   ```ts
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };
   ```
8. **Save the file.**

## 6. **Start the Admin Panel**

1. In your terminal, make sure you‚Äôre still in the project folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Wait for a message like:
   ```
   VITE vX.X.X  ready in XXX ms
   ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port shown).

  ```ts
  const ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS = [
    'your@email.com',
    // add more emails here
  ];
  ```

If you want to access your admin panel from anywhere (not just your computer):

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. The built files will be in the `dist/` folder.
3. Deploy the `dist/` folder to a service like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **Firebase Hosting**.
   - Each service has its own instructions‚Äîjust search ‚ÄúDeploy to Netlify‚Äù or ‚ÄúDeploy to Vercel‚Äù for step-by-step guides.
